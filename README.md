# DoorDash Frontend Interview Project
* TLDR: *Build a chat app with real APIs*
* Time: *3hr - 6hrs*
* Frame work user : React JS


## Howdy! ðŸ‘‹  

This is the frontend project! I have built a basic chat app which can be used bya user to join a chat room and send and view messages by other users

## Getting started
There's a few things you need to get started on to get this to work.

### 1. Installing minimum deps
Make sure you have `node` installed, with a version greater than `7.0.0`. We highly recommend [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), or just installing the latest version of `node` with `brew install node` on macOS.

Once you have a good `node` installed, run `npm install` in this repo to get your dependencies. Alternatively, you can use `yarn` instead.

### 2. Serving your app
By default, you can run `npm start` to run your app, serving the files from `/public`. You can, however, change this to whatever you want! Just make sure you document the changes somewhere so we can run this.

### 3. Running the api server
We have provided a simple api server for you. You can run `npm run api-server` to start it. Read the [spec](./spec/api-endpoints.md) for more details on the api.

### 4. Read the spec
There's a pretty fleshed out spec in the `./spec` directory. Checkout the [design specs here](./spec/designs/detailed-design-specs.md) to understand what I am building!

## Frameworkd used to build the app
* React JS
